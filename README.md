# CMPT276_PROJECT

Following our group’s first initial meeting, we were able to gain a solid understanding of each member's experience and personal interests. Nicholas, Arav, and Kenneth seemed to be familiar with back-end programming and have created some web-based applications in the past for personal projects while Steven and Tony expressed their interest in designing user interfaces and creating concise and organized navigational software. While none of our group were very familiar with using API’s, we had all done research on the topic and many of us were fond of using information from Google Maps. The topic of activities and different restaurants was mentioned and shortly after we concluded that we wanted to implement some form of travel itinerary. The itinerary would aim to help international students at Simon Fraser University who are unfamiliar with the city of Burnaby/Vancouver and can use it as an entertainment guide.

The current methods of travel planning often involve a combination of manual research and reliance on existing travel advisories and platforms such as TripAdvisor. While these resources offer valuable insights into popular attractions and dining options, they may not sufficiently cater to the specific needs and preferences of individual travelers, especially those who are new to the area. International students, in particular, face the challenge of navigating a new city without the benefit of local knowledge or established networks.
Recognizing the existing methods of travel planning as time-consuming and often lacking personalization, requiring users to sift through a plethora of options to create a cohesive plan for their day. The proposed web application seeks to streamline the process of itinerary planning by providing tailored suggestions for activities, dining options, and sightseeing destinations throughout the day. By automating this process, users, particularly international students, will benefit from a curated guide that maximizes their exploration of the Greater Vancouver area. 

The target audience primarily comprises members of the International Student Society at SFU and affiliated individuals seeking to discover the region's offerings. With a focus on simplicity and utility, the project's scope revolves around a central feature: generating comprehensive travel itineraries. This main feature encompasses several subproblems, including saving user preferences, randomly generating activities, and facilitating itinerary sharing.
Key features of the proposed application include a share function for generated itineraries, a database to store past travel plans, and a random activity generator akin to Google's "I'm feeling lucky" button. Central to the user experience is the itinerary planner, which presents a structured outline for the day, encompassing morning, mid-day, and evening activities along with dining recommendations.

In addition to these core functionalities, our team envisions incorporating small features that add significant value to the user experience. Alongside budgeting tools, weather considerations, and customizable filters, we plan to implement a language toggle feature. This feature will allow users to seamlessly switch between different languages to cater to a diverse user base, including international students who may prefer to navigate the website in their native language. By offering this flexibility, we aim to enhance accessibility and inclusivity, ensuring that all users can engage with the platform comfortably and effectively.

For instance, imagine an international student like Farquad, who, along with his friends, wishes to explore Vancouver over a weekend. Farquad, being new to the area, relies on the web application to create a personalized itinerary based on his preferences and current location. Through the application, he can effortlessly plan activities, dining options, and sightseeing destinations for the day, while also sharing the itinerary with his friends and accessing past suggestions. This scenario highlights the practical utility and user-centric features of the proposed application, emphasizing its ability to enhance the travel planning experience for individuals like Farquad.

We will integrate several APIs into our web application to enhance its functionality and provide users with a seamless experience. First, the Google Maps API will be utilized extensively for location services, allowing users to identify their current location and find nearby points of interest such as restaurants, cafes, and attractions. Additionally, we will leverage Google Maps' review and rating data to help users make informed decisions about their destinations. The Weather Network API will provide real-time weather information for the Greater Vancouver area, enabling the application to adjust itinerary suggestions based on weather conditions. For example, it can recommend indoor activities during inclement weather or outdoor excursions when conditions are favorable. Finally, the Gemini AI will play a crucial role in generating personalized itineraries by considering factors like weather, distance, budget, and user preferences. By integrating these APIs, we aim to create a comprehensive travel planning tool that caters to the diverse needs of our users while offering intelligent and relevant suggestions for their adventures in Vancouver.

In addition to that, our team has established connections with a relevant client who is the founder of a startup focused on student organization, to explore potential synergies and collaborations. By aligning with the startup's mission and leveraging existing networks within the SFU community, the team aims to enhance the visibility and adoption of their web application among the international student society of Simon Fraser University.
In conclusion, the proposed web application represents a concerted effort to address the unique needs of international students at SFU by offering a user-friendly solution for itinerary planning. Through collaboration, innovation, and strategic partnerships, the team endeavors to create a valuable tool that simplifies travel planning and enhances the overall student experience in the Greater Vancouver area. The amount of work required in the proposal is sufficient for a group of five members, especially considering the utilization of Google Maps and weather APIs, as well as the incorporation of numerous small features that blend characteristics of both services. Recognizing the importance of aesthetically pleasing travel itineraries, our team anticipates challenges in front-end design, yet remains committed to delivering an innovative and user-centric solution.
